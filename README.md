In this project I used Java, JavaFX, DataBase and SceneBuilder.
  - Java is the main language in this program.
  
  - JavaFX is a framework contains API's that allow developers to create user interfaces using the Java language.
    
  - DataBase is the place where I recorded all the information about client and appointment.
  
  - SceneBulder is an application to styling the Front-end of my application and it's translated through HTML so that it can also be seen in the main Java program.

This program can be used to make appointments to various barbers.

      ✔️ The first step is to create an account to be able to access the application. 

      ✔️ Once entered the client's information will be recorded in a database(id, firstname, lastname, username, password).

      ✔️ The second step is to log in, then you can choose the appointment according to the barber.

      ✔️ If the hairdresser is available you can choose the day and time of the appointment. 

      ✔️ The table for hairdressers has 2 fields (id, name)

      ✔️ If one of the barbers is not available, you can choose someone else in his place. 

      ✔️ All these will be entered in the same table in database, for appointment(idbarber, iduser, date, hour).
